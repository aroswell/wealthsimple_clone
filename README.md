##WealthSimple-Clone## (written in Ruby, running with Sinatra and Thin)

This app is a knock off of www.wealthsimple.com. It was originally built in Rails but I've decided to use Sinatra and venture beyond some of the Rails magic.

The app is set up to read environment variables from a .dev_env and .test_env file.
